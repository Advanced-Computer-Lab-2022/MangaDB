## Revamp

- Is an E-learning platform that provides various courses in all major and minor fields for students to buy.
  
- Provides a platform for instructors to post their content and make profit out of it.

## Motivation

- This Website was created as a group University
  (German University in Cairo) project for the course CSEN704 Course (Advanced Programming Lab).

- The purpose of creating such project is to learn and practice the MERN  (MongoDB , ExpressJS , ReactJS, NodeJS) Technology Stack in creating fullstack scalable web applications, learn how to follow a set of User and System Requirements to develop a fully functioning software, learn how to split the use-cases into tasks and distribute them among the team.

## Build Status

- The Current Build Of the project contains no bugs or malfunctions, however additional features will be added to the project in future releases.

## Code Styles

- Standard coding style is used , however most functions and code blocks are documented for future reference.

## Tech/Frameworks

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) was used as a noSQL database to store the models and information. 
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications with a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) which is a component based JavaScript library for building and developing user interfaces that provides reusability and flexibility.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which is an environment that permits the user to write normal JavaScript code that is highly performant and easy to use to build scalable network applications.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) was used to develop both the backend and the frontend codes.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for styling our html components.
