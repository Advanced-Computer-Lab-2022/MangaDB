- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) was used as a noSQL database to store the models and information. 
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications with a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) which is a component based JavaScript library for building and developing user interfaces that provides reusability and flexibility.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which is an environment that permits the user to write normal JavaScript code that is highly performant and easy to use to build scalable network applications.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) was used to develop both the backend and the frontend codes.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for styling our html components.
